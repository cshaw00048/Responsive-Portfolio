        Welcome to my portfolio page. I would first like to say thank you for
        taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I would describe myself
        as very driven. I love to work. I love to learn. I love to get better. I
        love to succeed. My every day goal is to get a little bit better every
        day at everything that's important to me. I believe the key to
        improvement is developing a process that when applied consistently makes
        you better at whatever skill you want to build. My whole day is a
        process to improve as a person, as a husband, as a parent, and as a Full
        Stack Developer.

        My family is what is most important to me. On paper they get the least
        of my time. But if you include providing for them, they get the most of
        my time. My career is also very important to me. With the dedication I
        give those two things, I don't have time for much else. I like to say
        those things keep me out of trouble. Coding can be considered my hobby
        for now. But when it is my career I want to continue to study in order
        to improve, explore knowledge, as well as learn other programming
        languages. I'm just getting started.

        What sets me apart as a developer is my mentality. I want to be great. I
        am willing to put the work in to make that happen. It's not in me to be
        "just another guy". I have to be striving to be the best or I feel like
        I will explode. I have a very high bar when it comes to the expectations
        of myself, but I don't put pressure on myself. Over time the power of
        water can break or carve rocks. Over time the power of a good schedule
        and process can create anything, including great coders. There may be
        others out there who are better than me for now. But in order to
        continue to be better than me, they will have to sacrfice.
